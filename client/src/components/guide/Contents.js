You have a few hours to make breakfast, get ready for the day, and get stuck in a traffic jam on the way to work, the dreaded place where you'll stay for the next 8-10 hours. Then, when it's time to clock out, you'll crawl through rush hour traffic all over again and finally step back into your beloved home until to make dinner and veg out on the couch, trying to forget your long and stressful day...</p>
                <p>At least, that used to be the expectation for a job.</p>

                <p>The 21st-century has brought society quite a lot. In addition to being able to order your favorite anything with just a couple clicks and even have it brought to your door that same day, technology has afforded us a lot more than convenience--it's given us freedom. The freedom afforded by technology is allowing more people than ever to stay home and work remotely, especially those in technical fields.</p>

                <p>The differences between traditional work and remote work are extensive. They stretch far beyond your daily routine and can encompass your affordability, flexibility, happiness, health, and so much more. For instance, while you’ll still have to clock in and out at a certain time in most positions as a software developer, you still have the freedom to get up, move around, and even multitask when you have some downtime.</p>

                <p>This is much more productive and morale-boosting compared to being stuck in an office environment all day long, no matter how fast or slow time may be moving. As a remote software developer, you'll also enjoy the opportunity to work outside of your home, which can be especially rewarding.</p>

                <p>You see, as a remote worker, you aren’t tied to any particular place. While you might choose to work from your home office, you could also take your work to a local co-working space, to a local park, or even to the beach like many social media posters brag about.</p>

                <p>Now, this approach of “remote workers” has definitely been adopted in multiple industries, but there are extra benefits that come along with being a remote software developer, in particular. First and foremost, many positions for software developers will not require you to clock in and out at specific times.</p>

                <p>While you may be asked to work so many hours out of the week or be available during certain times, many positions afford software developers more flexibility and time freedom than ever before. Say you're a night owl: now you can finish your day's work at your most productive and convenient times rather than being forced to sit in a office chair 8 hours out of the day.</p>

                <p>Of course, how many hours you work will depend on your projects, your position, and your pay. Some remote jobs are hourly, which means you only get paid when you have “clocked in” and are working, while others are salary, which means you’ll just have to get in a minimum number of hours each week or month and still make the same amount.</p>

                <p>Either kind of pay could be beneficial to you, it all comes down to figuring out your flexibility and how much time freedom you are after. With the number of remote software developer positions available today, you have plenty of choices!</p>

                <p>In fact, you could even be a freelance software developer, hopping from one company to another where you are needed, charging a premium for your services, and not being bound by any company’s culture or policies in particular. Let’s compare all three of these kinds of offers that you might run across as a remote software developer.</p>

              </div>
              <div className="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-two" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-two-tab">

                <strong>Remote Software Developer, Hourly</strong>
                <p>In an hourly position as a remote software developer, the company may hire you on full-time or part-time, which will dictate how many hours a week you are expected to work. In general, if you work more than a certain number of hours (because a project calls for it), you will be paid overtime (which is your base salary and a half in most cases).</p>

                <p>Depending on the position and what all your job title describes, you may be asked to clock in for a certain number of hours minimum each week at any time you desire or you may be given a work schedule, like clocking in between 9 AM and 5 PM each day. You might also experience a mix of the two, like maybe you’ll need to be available for testing and troubleshooting between noon and 3 PM, but otherwise you can choose when to get in the rest of your hours.</p>


                <p>Typically, as a full-time employee, you are going to be offered all the employee benefits that other workers get, like perhaps a company insurance plan, paid time off, and so on. A part-time employee may also be entitled to some of those benefits, but be sure to ask when applying.</p>


                <strong>Remote Software Developer, Salary</strong>
                <p>As a salary worker, you are going to get a fixed pay every year regardless of how little or how much you work. Now, you will still likely be required to meet a minimum number of hours each week/month, but this means if you only work on an as-needed basis at the company, you may only work 30 hours one week and then 42 the next at the same pay.</p>


                <p>If you do happen to be putting in a significant number of overtime hours, you may be compensated for that extra time by the company and it would be grounds to ask for a pay increase (or to switch to hourly pay, which may be more appropriate in that situation).</p>


                <p>That’s really the biggest downside to a salary position, but it can also be a huge upside. Just think about it: If you can get more done in less time, you don’t have to clock in for 10 hours when you only need to work 8 and you’re going to get the same pay at the end of the week.</p>


                <p>Of course, choosing between hourly and salary is largely going to depend on the company you are applying for and their expectations of you. If you will only be needed on a case-by-case basis, salary might get you more income with fewer hours worked. If you will constantly be working on things with daily tasks, hourly might be the better way to go, but you’ll need to compare the specific job offerings when making your decision.</p>


                <p>A salary worker can also be classified as either part-time or full-time, which part-time workers obviously getting fewer (if any) benefits since they are capped at a certain number of hours per week. If you consistently work more than that set number of hours, you are really working full-time for the company and you need to be compensated as such by means of a pay increase and benefits.</p>


                <strong>Remote Software Developer, Freelance</strong>
                <p>As a freelance software developer, you’ll enjoy all the freedoms of working remotely, plus you’ll get to set your own schedule! You won’t be tied to any particular company, which means you won’t get the benefits of being an employee, but instead you’ll take on projects as they are offered to you.</p>


                <p>In order to get software development projects as a remote freelancer, you would want to network with companies and also look on popular freelance platforms where companies (and individuals) may post such jobs. They would range in value and complexity, but as a freelancer, you can set your own hourly rate to compensate you for your work.</p>

              <div className="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-three" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-three-tab">
                <p>While we have already touched on some of the reasons why you might want to work as a remote software developer, let’s explore all the perks in full.</p>


                <strong>Less Stress</strong>
                <p>From ignoring the rush hour traffic to knowing you don’t even have to get out of your pajamas in order to start your work day, the less time you spend getting to work, getting home from work, and worrying about work in general all contribute to the lower stress levels that remote workers enjoy. No more weather problems or traffic delays. You will be empowered to work in a way that is comfortable and most productive for you.</p>


                <strong>You’re Connected</strong>
                <p>“Telecommuting” has been around for a very long time, but it’s only recently that remote workers have finally begun to feel like they are part of the companies they are working for. Today, with the widespread use of social media and the ability to text, call, or live chat at any given second, you’ll be uber connected with the office you’re working for even if you’re not on site.</p>


                <strong>You’ll Be More Engaged</strong>
                <p>Many companies who regularly hire remote workers say that their remote workers are more engaged with their fellow team members, perhaps attributed to the decreased stress levels and increased flexibility to work when you want and in a way that works best for you. For instance, Nationwide’s spokeperson stated: “When you're tweeting with people in your team close to midnight, it brings home that people are experiencing something beyond 'doing work' — they're engaged in a different way."</p>


                <strong>You’ll Have Access To Better Facilities</strong>
                <p>As touched on previously, as a remote worker, you’ll have the freedom to take your job with you where ever you choose to go. That might mean the park, the beach, or even with you on a trip. You might also be able to work from local facilities that are better suited to your concentration, creativity, and/or productivity compared to a standard office environment.</p>

              </div>
              <div className="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-four" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-four-tab">
                <p>Now that you know all the reasons why you may want to be a remote software developer, let’s take a peek at the reasons why a company would want to hire remote workers.</p>


                <strong>They Cost Less</strong>
                <p>In the world of business, everything comes down to the dollar, and remote workers are simply cheaper. By encouraging their employees to work in different ways, they save on office space, cleanup, supplies, electricity, and so much more.</p>


                <strong>Everyone Benefits From Absenteeism</strong>
                <p>Companies have found that the “remote from office” type absenteeism eliminates the necessity for “presenteeism” or the need for a worker to be in the office as much as possible. This helps workers find a work/life balance and, therefore, boosts their morale. They are also more productive when they are clocked in and working. No more twiddling their thumbs on a slow day!</p>


                <strong> They’re Happier</strong>
                <p>Remote workers are simply happier than their commuter counterparts for all the reasons mentioned above and more. This contributes to a positive company culture, more productive teams, and more inspired employees who are ready to give things their all when they are needed. Obviously, companies get a big boost from such an attitude.</p>

              </div>
              <div className="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-five" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-five-tab">
                <p>As a remote worker, you’ll quickly adapt to an all new approach to working--one that you have likely dreamt about many times before. Let’s have a look at the qualities that are of special importance for remote workers to adopt.</p>


                <strong>Communication</strong>
                <p>Communication will definitely be at the top of your list when figuring out what qualities you need to hone in on as a remote worker. Let’s face it: Your company cares about what you’re doing with your time! They want to know that you are actually working while you’re “on the clock” and getting paid, whether hourly or salary.</p>

                <p>This means you need to be very good at communicating what you are doing and staying on top of what people are expecting of you. Not only do you need to be able to communicate with your supervisors to discuss your weekly milestones and progress on various projects, you also need to be able to collaborate with your fellow team members long-distance to figure out what they’re doing and how you can help them succeed.</p>

                <p>Additionally, you need to be ready and willing to communicate in many different ways. As a remote worker, people may need to reach you for many different things at all sorts of different times. You may even need to be on-call, depending on the software you are working on. You need to be able to effectively communicate over the phone, through text messages, through email, and through the method many people dread: live chat!</p>

                <p>While you likely have a preferred way of communicating, and you should express that to the company when they are hiring you, you also need to plan on being able to communicate using a mix of all of the above methods.</p>


                <ins>I Really Don’t Want To Speak!</ins>
                <p>Many remote workers choose to be remote because they are introverts by nature. That’s understandable and it’s something many companies are actually aware of. However, as a modern-day worker, you need to be flexible enough to communicate in many different fashions.</p>

                <p>While you will still need to join a conference call or live chat at some point or another, you can inform the company (preferably at onboarding) about your prefered ways of communicating with the team. Here are some reasons why you may favor email/text over other methods that you should share with them.</p>

                <p>You may prefer written communication because it enables you to check it when you receive it and then respond based on its urgency. For instance, you might see an email and know you need to get back to them right away, or someone may send you a non-urgent message and that means, since it’s written, you can continue working without breaking your train of thought and respond at a later time.</p>

                <p>Whatever reason you tell the company, be sure to let them know that you will be available to speak on the phone as necessary because communication is very important for your success as a remote worker.</p>


                <strong>Attitude</strong>
                <p>If you are going to take on a full-time position as a remote software developer only to hate what you are doing or the company you are working for, you better not take it. Maybe you think no one will know the difference since you are so far away, but let’s face it: your attitude will shine through in your work quality, productivity, and when you communicate with your team.</p>

                <p>Plus, who wants to work a job that they aren't going to enjoy? If you do not see yourself ever levelling up in the company, if you don't like your team, if you don't like the projects, or if you aren't okay with the position and its responsibilities in general, you need to keep looking! A positive attitude is of vital importance for your own morale and for the company you are working for.</p>


                <strong> Productivity</strong>
                <p>A remote worker shouldn’t have to wait around to get assignments and tasks every single day. You should be a self-starter and a “doer” who is able to jump right into projects, ask questions when needed, and then take action to figure out what’s next when you complete a given project.</p>

                <p>Being a “doer” is really important in any workplace today. No one should have to constantly reach out to you to figure out where you’re at. You should give progress reports regularly to keep people on the same page (remember: communication is key!) and you should know who to contact when you finish a project so that you can find out what to start working on next.</p>

                <p>You should not just wait for someone to give you something to do, silently complete it, and then wait for something else. If you are actively going after new opportunities and projects, that is going to reflect very positively on you as a worker and it’s something companies really like to see.</p>


                <strong>Adaptability</strong>
                <p>Being able to adapt to changes in the company, in the workflow, and in your own processes is really important as a remote worker. You may think that changes at the company won't affect you that much, but they can. As a remote worker, you need to stay on top of who you need to be keeping "in the loop" about your active projects, who you are supposed to collaborate with, who supervises you, and so on.</p>

                <p>You also need to be ready for changes in the systems you are using as a remote worker. For instance, your company will probably give you a company email, perhaps some applications to stay in touch with the team, and many other tools. These tools will be updated, phased out, and replaced over time. You need to be able to adapt to these changes as they occur.</p>


                <strong>Reliability</strong>
                <p>As a remote worker, it’s simply not acceptable that internet connection issues and similar problems are stopping you from working. You need to have a reliable internet connection and phone service so that you can be reached during normal work hours. You also need to have a backup for such if you live in an area where it’s likely that your service can be too slow or cut out.</p>

                <p>At the same time, you need to be reliable as a worker. When given a deadline, you have to meet it or, at the very least, let your team members know as far in advance as possible when there is going to be a delay. When someone gives you a project and a deadline, they are counting on you to meet that deadline. It is your sole responsibility to meet it or inform them otherwise.</p>

                <p>This also goes back to communication. For instance, if you already have a lot on your plate and a supervisor assigns you a deadline that is simply going to be impossible to meet, it’s better to let them know about that now and propose a more realistic deadline that you can follow through with than burning yourself out trying to get everything done at once.</p>


                <strong>Organization</strong>
                <p>As a remote worker, you’re going to have to stay on top of where things are and what’s due when. Organization is really important to keeping yourself productive as a remote worker, and it applies to your life on multiple levels.</p>

                <p>Your home office is able to get much more disorganized than a work office ever could, and that could certainly affect productivity. You should keep your work space organized and you should also keep the computers and equipment you need to do your work organized and easily accessible.</p>

                <p>At the same time, you need to know how to prioritize so that you can get things done as needed. Figuring out your own work flow or joining a company work flow can help you do just that. Having a calendar with due dates and deadlines can also be of big assistance to you when it comes to prioritization.</p>


                <strong>Time Management</strong>
                <p>Not being tied to a strict time schedule throughout the day when you’re stuck in the office is considered a blessing by every remote worker out there. You can get up when you need to and be more flexible with when you’re working--but, that can quickly get out of hand.</p>

                <p>Without time management, you may find yourself actually being too involved in your remote work or doing just the opposite and always putting things off. If you are a procrastinator, that is something that definitely needs to change when you become a remote worker.</p>

                <p>Being a self-starter and taking a initiative is a big thing for remote workers. You need to also lay out your schedule, perhaps using a day planner, to help ensure that you are taking full advantage of the flexibility being a remote worker provides you while also making sure you are actually working enough out of the day to meet your deadlines and stay on top of things.</p>


                <strong>Independence</strong>
                <p>As a remote worker, you will be working on your own the majority of the time. Yes, you do need to be able to communicate and collaborate as described earlier, but when you aren’t communicating with a team member, most of your work is going to be completed in your own office on your own.</p>

                <p>This means you need to be able to solve problems, manage your time, know when to stop, and know when to ask for help. You also have to be okay with the seclusion that remote work provides. Although you may have a morning conference call, beyond that, you will be on your own and left to your own devices. If you are a very team or group oriented person, that may not be the right fit for you. Make sure you still have plenty of social outlets.</p>

              </div>
              <div className="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-six" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-six-tab">
                <p>Before you begin finding opportunities for jobs, it’s a good idea to note some of the ways that you can demonstrate your technical skills to others online.</p>

                <p>Not only can actively participating in these methods in itself help you score new opportunities (by potentially leading you to being discovered by clients and/or recruiters), you can also use these methods to build up a reputation for your work and even a portfolio of your skills and past projects.</p>


                <strong>GitHub</strong>
                <p>As a software developer, you should most certainly be familiar with GitHub. GitHub is a place where you can participate in open source coding projects and even share things you’re working on yourself. You can get input from other developers, help them out, and in general, collaborate with your peers.</p>

                <p>GitHub is also an excellent way to build up a portfolio of small projects that you can point people to in the future if they want to see some real-world examples of your work. You can develop GitHub projects in your free time and, in other cases, it might turn out to be a really valuable situation for you to get involved with other developers and help them out.</p>

                <p>People use GitHub when they need input on projects and they often go there first when looking for a developer for their next project. Being present on the platform can certainly help level up your career as a software developer. Always link to your GitHub profile from your website and all of your professional pages and don’t be afraid to mention it on your resume and at your interview too.</p>


                <strong>StackOverflow</strong>
                <p>StackOverflow is another platform that you should be regularly participating on as a software developer. Here, however, you won’t be contributing to projects. Instead, you’ll be showing off your knowledge by answering the questions of other developers.</p>

                <p>Building up a good reputation will help strengthen your position as a software developer. When people see how helpful you are, it may also prompt them to seek you out for collaboration opportunities and even paid work, so be sure to get on there regularly to lend your expertise.</p>

                <p>And, of course, you can also ask for input and answers yourself from other skilled developers to help your own projects keep moving forward.</p>


                <strong>Guest Posting</strong>
                <p>In addition to the above, there are countless other ways for you to demonstrate your techical skills. Guest posting is one of those lesser-used ways that you can show off your knowledge as a software developer.</p>

                <p>Being a guest poster means that you write a tutorial or lesson and someone else will post it on their website. They get free content and you get to reach their audience! It’s a win/win. If you happen to be up for writing, writing content for sites like Medium can also strengthen your reputation greatly.</p>

                <p>When you get your tutorials published on platforms like Medium, and especially if you manage to make it onto any well-known technical sites, be sure to mention those on your LinkedIn portfolio, on a special page at your website, and even on your resume where applicable.</p>

                <p>As a remote worker, you likely won’t be physically attending any job interviews. More than likely, you’ll be conducting any interviews you get over the phone or through a live chat. But, how do you go about finding those interview opportunities?</p>


                <strong>Job Search Sites</strong>
                <p>Traditional job search sites, like Indeed.com, will help you locate opportunities for remote positions as a software developer. Other job search sites will also feature some available positions, just stick “Remote” into the location field and you’ll see lots of open positions.</p>

                <p>Some companies are searching for full-time workers, some for part-time, some for freelancers, and some for a mix of on-site/remote. The latter requires that you actually commute to the office at some point, whether that’s on a weekly basis, a monthly basis, or as needed. This means you should plan to take a trip there, whether the company will fly you there or if it’s close enough for you to drive.</p>

                <p>Don’t get discouraged, however, many companies are seeking full-time remote employees who will never have to step foot through the office doors, essentially meaning you can stay in your “home office casual” attire for the rest of your life. Figure out what you think would work best for you and go for it.</p>


                <strong>Networking</strong>
                <p>There are many opportunities to be found through your own network of professionals. Asking around with the people you already know can go  very far--you'd be amazed what a mutual referral can do for your career! You should also be actively networking with new professionals.</p>

                <p>Part of this can be handled online through sites like LinkedIn where you can reach out to recruiters and actually get found by companies who are looking for talent like you directly. You can also ask your LinkedIn connections about job opportunities.</p>

                <p>Cold emailing your LinkedIn connections is just one way to grow your network and find opportunities, however (and it works particularly well for freelancers seeking work). You should also be networking in person, too, at local events and association meetings that relate to your work as a software developer.</p>

                <p>The fact is, many companies today are in a position where they are seeking out software developers whether for their front-end or back-end operations, so you have countless opportunities for work. They may not all be full-time and they may not all interest you, but don’t for a second believe that there’s not an opportunity out there for you.</p>


                <strong>Newspapers & Magazines</strong>
                <p>There are still job listings in newspapers, believe it or not, and while they are usually local-oriented, you can search magazines and national newspapers and journals online to find some job opportunities. Usually these are with big name companies who are looking for top talent, so be ready to present yourself as such.</p>

              </div>
              <div className="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-eight" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-eight-tab">
                <p>Once you have found an opportunity, you might feel the need to pounce on it instantly out of fear that someone else is going to swipe it out from under you. While that can happen, you need to be very well-planned in your approach to any available position in order to show off how talented and communicative you really are.</p>


                <strong>Get On LinkedIn</strong>
                <p>If you didn’t get the hint from the last section, you most definitely need to be on LinkedIn! LinkedIn is like Facebook for professionals and just about every recruiter out there is a member. If you aren’t on LinkedIn, you are missing out on countless opportunities already.</p>

                <p>When you join LinkedIn, be sure to go through their setup wizard and fill in as many blanks as possible, like your previous experience, your biography, your education, and so on. Add a professional headshot and be sure to link to all your professional profiles (like your website).</p>

                <p>Go into your settings and list yourself as “Actively Seeking” so that recruiters can find you and contact you when they have job opportunities that they are trying to fill. Get specific about what you are looking for, like the time commitment and type of company you’d like to work with.</p>

                <p>If you are a freelance developer, you should add each project you have completed in separately in the experience section. Be sure to link it to the company's official LinkedIn page and give a solid description of what exactly you did while working on the project. Clarify that it was a Freelance, Contract, or Temporary position when listing it on your profile.</p>


                <strong>Setup A Website</strong>
                <p>A website can be like your online resume and portfolio that you can direct recruiters to when they want to learn more about your talents and experience. A website can say more than a resume can (or should) ever say and it can also be shown in a way that’s very appealing to the eye.</p>

                <p>Having an eye-catching website can also get you attention from recruiters and companies looking for a software developer even when you are not in active search of a work opportunity. So, have a contact form on your website and link to your LinkedIn profile (and vice versa) to keep your eyes peeled for new positions.</p>

                <p>Having a website is, of course, crucially important to a freelance software developer as it will help people find you when they need a developer and it will also increase your chances of being hired for the projects that you find ten-fold. But, it can also be very helpful for those applying for a part or full-time position as well, so don’t underestimate its power.</p>

                <p>For instance, maybe you do take on a full-time job but then a company discovers you through your website and wants you for a temporary freelance position. You could do both and get some extra money in your pocket while expanding upon your experience and connecting with a company that can take your career even further. </p>


                <strong>Get Business Cards</strong>
                <p>You never know when you’ll meet someone who could be your next partner or even your next boss. You should always have business cards at the ready everywhere you go.</p>

                <p>Carry a couple extras in your wallet at all times and replenish them as you pass them out. When you know that you are going to an event or somewhere that you are likely to meet multiple potential people whom you can add to your network, bring lots of business cards.</p>

                <p>Your business card should include your phone number, email, and your website’s address so that they can get in touch with you.</p>


                <strong>Prepare Your Resume</strong>
                <p>When applying for any position, the resume is what every recruiter is going to look at first and last. Ultimately, they are going to have a big stack of them on their desk, and yours needs to stand out if you ever want to get called up for an interview opportunity.</p>

                <p>There are a few different ways to make your resume stand out. In order to be successful, you should follow the do’s and don’ts provided below.</p>


                <ins>Keep It Short</ins>
                <p>A long resume is going to be glanced over and thrown into the other pile. A one-page resume is easy to digest and it will be short enough that the recruiter is more than likely going to actually look it all the way over. This will give your words more impact, even though you’ll be using fewer words. A short resume will also put greater emphasis on the things you can fit onto the page.</p>


                <ins>Format It Right</ins>
                <p>The hiring manager is the one responsible for compiling all the important information from the resumes they accept into a structured format so that they can compare, contrast, and eventually decide who to call in. By structuring your resume right from the start, you save them a lot of trouble and make it easy for them to see what’s important.</p>

                <p>Generally, a person will scan your resume for around 25 seconds. If the font is hard to read, too small, too close, or improperly spaced, all of these is going to waste time. If it exceeds more than two pages (remember, keep it one page if you can!) or if it’s poorly organized, the important parts can easily be skipped.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Use bulleted lists to call attention to the important things, like your accomplishments.</li>
                  <li>Use a logical format with wide margins, a clean font, and clear and bold headings to section it out.</li>
                  <li>Apply bold and italic typeface where needed (and very sparingly) to call attention to what’s important and help bring their eye to where you really want it on the page.</li>
                </ul>

                <ins>Identify Your Accomplishments</ins>
                <p>Speaking of accomplishments, it is very important that you identify your accomplishments in your previous positions rather than simply copy/pasting a job description. As a software developer, you are entering into a company to help them solve problems and come up with creative solutions.</p>

                <p>They won’t hire somebody who can’t tell them how they helped do that in their previous positions. Hence, you need to identify your accomplishments in your previous roles so that you can show off to hiring managers just how great of a fit you’re going to be at this new company.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Focus on what you did on the job, not what your job was.</li>
                  <li>Include a one or two line description first, and then list out your accomplishments.</li>
                  <li>For each bullet point you add, ask yourself: “What was the benefit of having done what I did?”</li>
                  <li>The accomplishments should be unique to you and your previous role. Don’t snag a generic list from the internet!</li>

                </ul>

                <ins>Quantify Your Accomplishments</ins>
                <p>People make countless mistakes when creating their resumes, but to help you out, remember that a resume is a marketing document. It is meant to sell your skills and accomplishments to the reader, not give them a complete biography of who you are.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Highlight your achievements that will give the hiring manager a comprehensive look at your marketability</li>
                  <li>Quantify your achievements to give the hiring manager greater confidence and generate their interest with percentages, dollars, numbers, etc.</li>
                  <li>Work backwards in order to quantify your achievements by asking yourself, “I had not done X, what would have happened?”</li>

                </ul>

                <ins>Don’t Go Overboard With Design</ins>
                <p>If you were applying for a creative position as an artist, creative writer, or someone else who falls more into the craftsy field, it would almost be expected of you to present a unique resume design that’s appealing to the eye. However, in a technical field like software development, clean is probably the way to go.</p>

                <p>As a software developer, having an over-the-top resume design can actually turn a hiring manager off to your resume just because it may appear cluttered or stand out from the stack in a bad way. Best to go classic, clean, and professional for this one.</p>

                <ins>Use A “Career Summary” Instead Of An “Objective”</ins>
                <p>Far too many people follow the basic format of an “Objective” and end up saying nothing at all. “Seeking a challenging, interesting position in X where I can use my skills of X, Y, and Z to contribute to the bottom line.”</p>

                <p>Instead, use a career summary that says who you are and what you do. Develop a career summary that is going to grab the hiring manager’s attention and really make then eager to call you up for a follow-up. The summary should accurately and powerfully describe you as the perfect solution to their problems.</p>

                <p>For this reason, you should put in the extra legwork and read your resume’s career summary with each position you are applying for. Tweaking it slightly to fit the description that each company has proposed will help it stand out further and show them just how great of a fit you will be. </p>

                <ins>Put Your Resume Online</ins>
                <p>Since you will be applying for remote work, you are likely going to be doing that remotely. This calls for a virtual resume so that you can direct hiring managers to it in a snap.</p>

                <p>You can scan your resume and/or send it as a PDF file, but the best thing to do is dedicate a page on your website to your official resume. You can make it a little more eye catching this way and also update it on the fly. </p>

                <strong>Network</strong>
                <p>With your resume prepared, you have to begin networking. Yes, this was mentioned in the last section, but it needs to be mentioned again since it is of such vital importance. If you are unemployed and actively seeking a job, you should treat networking as a full-time job.</p>

                <p>Networking both online and offline is of vital importance to actually finding a position that you will love quickly. Have business cards at the ready and plenty of resumes so that you can hand them out at a moment’s notice.</p>

                <p>Don’t be afraid to send a virtual copy of your resume to recruiters and companies online, to direct them to your website, or to cold email them to try and get their attention.</p>

                <ins>Soft Follow-Up</ins>
                <p>The follow-up is a very important part of networking. When you meet someone in person, for instance, and you exchange business cards, a great way to “soft” follow-up (meaning you won’t feel like you’re nagging them but rather continuing the professional relationship building) is to find them on LinkedIn and send them a connection request.</p>

                <p>When you do this, be sure that you include a custom message that they will see alongside your request, like: “Hey John! Glad to find you on LinkedIn. It was great speaking with you earlier at X about Y. Let’s connect!”</p>

                <ins>Hard Follow-Up</ins>
                <p>A hard follow-up can be used when you have someone’s direct contact information and you would like to move things forward. This can seem pushy if approached incorrectly, however. You should only use this follow-up method if you have already conversed with them about an active opportunity that you are seeking to fill and you haven’t heard back from them within 5-7 days.</p>

                <p>You should work your follow-up tactfully and preferably email it to them rather than calling, as that will seem like the least pushy and most respectful thing to do.</p>

                <p>Just send a quick email telling them that you’re checking in on the opportunity and wondering if they’ve had the chance to review X (your resume, website, or something you have sent them previously). If you haven’t yet submitted one of the above, you can say something like “Hey Name, I noticed I never got the chance to send my resume over. I’ll attach it here so you can have a look.”</p>

                <p>This follow-up method is good for chasing an opportunity where the person may be disorganized and forgetting to follow-up with you. It can serve as a friendly reminder and keep you at the front of their mind, but again, it’s not necessary or polite to email someone in your network unless you know there is an active opportunity to discuss.</p>

                <strong>Who To Contact</strong>
                <p>There are a million networking opportunities out there. First, go to LinkedIn to connect with people you already know and companies you have touched with in the past. Then, find mutual connections of people that those people know and send them connection requests too.</p>

                <p>You should also be actively thinking about people you have worked with in the past along with sales reps and vendors you have worked with before. Be sure to send them a friendly message with the request, pointing out how you know them. Also, check the alumni directory of your alma mater.</p>

              </div>
              <div className="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-nine" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-nine-tab">
                <p>It finally happened: All the networking paid off and you got a bite back on your submissions. The next step is to converse with the hiring manager about the opportunity. They’ll probably have some preliminary questions to ask before moving to the next step: the interview.</p>

                <p>Depending on the company, you may even be given a sample development task, a knowledge quiz, or even a quiz to see how well your personality and goals will match with the company culture. These are all basic hoops you’ll have to jump through to score a position as a software developer in today’s world.</p>

                <p>Once you have been given the greenlight and an interview has been setup, you’ll obviously experience the nerves that always accompany an interview for a new job. The best way to overcome those nerves is to prepare yourself and, to do that, you just need to practice.</p>

                <strong>Get Comfortable With The Communication Method</strong>

                <p>First and foremost, think about how the interview will be conducted. More than likely, you’ll be doing a live chat interview but it may be a phone interview. Ask yourself if you are comfortable communicating in this way. Obviously, you’ll have to if you want to get the job, but the point of this question is to judge whether you need to practice this portion of the interview itself or not.</p>

                <p>Go ahead and make sure that everything is in good working order and fully setup now so that you can focus on preparing for other parts of the interview. That means ensuring your home office where you’ll be conducting the interview is private, quiet, and has a good signal. You should also check the backdrop, tidy up the space, and dust your webcam.</p>

                <strong>Research The Organization</strong>

                <p>The next best thing you can do to prepare yourself for the interview is to research the company itself. This will help you learn a lot more about what it’s like to work for them and what may be expected of you in your new position. By doing this research, you can even impress them with just how much you know about the company already.</p>

                <p>This will also allow you to ask specific questions, if any come up, at the end of the interview when they ask if you have any questions. Having some intelligent, well-informed questions about the company--whether it’s about their background or something specific to your position--will show that you have real interest in the position and it beats saying, “None, thanks” any day of the week.</p>



                <ul>
                  <li>Look for background information about the company. How long have they been around? Where are they based?</li>
                  <li>Get an overview of the organization and a profile of the industry it is in.</li>
                  <li>Visit their website and understand what they are working towards.</li>
                  <li>Review their mission statement and founding story.</li>
                  <li>Assess their products, services, and their clients so you can understand what sort of software you may be developing.</li>
                  <li>Read recent reviews and also get an insight into their projected growth and stability.</li>
                  <li>Get a perspective by reading trade or business publications to better grasp the industry’s standing.</li>
                  <li>Develop your list of questions based on the above. You don't have to ask all of them, so prioritize the ones you want answers to the most or the ones you think will show the most interest in the organization.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Compare Yourself</strong>

                <p>In preparation for the interview, take a close look at the job description and analyze it. Compare your own skills and qualifications to what they are asking for. Your goal here is to figure out what strengths you can really highlight during your interview. For instance, if they happen to ask you about X but you're better at Y (and both are in the description as what they want), you can acknowledge their question and comfortably shift the focus to the subject that you have more experience with and are more apt to speak about.</p>

                <p>You should also examine the position to help figure out where it fits within the company hierarchy. What departments will you be communicating with regularly? How many people are in those departments? Who will be your closest collaborators and fellow team members?</p>

                <strong>Prepare Your Responses</strong>

                <p>Your interviewer is obviously going to ask a few questions that you didn't think about ahead of time, but there are other questions that are quite standard and you should completely expect them. Ahead of time, take the chance to prepare your story and figure out an engaging way to tell it.</p>

                <p>The questions they ask are going to be very open-ended because they want to hear you talk. They want to hear you speak about yourself, your experiences, and paint yourself as the perfect candidate for the position. Draw parallels between things you have done in the past and what they will be asking from you.</p>

                <p>Don't treat your interview as a back-and-forth, one-sided conversation where they ask you a question and you give a snippy answer. Rather, when they ask a question, feel free to elaborate, expand, and even ask them questions back. It can be very conversational in nature, just make sure you give them the chance to speak, explain, and ask questions as well.</p>

                <strong>Choose Your Wardrobe</strong>

                <p>While you can likely stay in your pajamas to work on the average day, your interview is still going to call for a professional outfit that shows off your clean cut experience. A dress shirt and jeans will usually suffice for the home interview. Be sure to brush your hair and teeth as it will show through, and if you think makeup could help make you look a bit more put together, it may be worth putting some on.</p>

                <p>You can get a good idea of what the company’s culture calls for in their dress code simply by going to their website or Facebook page and looking for pictures of employees at work (like on the teams or events page). If they appear to be business casual, match that and err towards formal to ensure you come across as professional and prepared rather than rushed or lazy.</p>

                <strong>Be Aware of Yourself</strong>

                <p>Body language says a lot and it is something most interviewers are going to be tuned into. Maybe you have spent hours researching this company and you already know all the things they are going to tell you about it by heart. Listen anyways!</p>

                <p>Be very mindful throughout the entire interview that you are paying attention to what the interviewer is saying to you and that you are smiling and excited to listen. Don’t allow yourself to wander off and know how to politely cut yourself off if you find yourself rambling. For instance, if you begin speaking and realize you may have gotten off topic or be going on for too long, simply excuse yourself and allow them to speak.</p>

                <p>Sit up straight as well because posture is very important in a virtual interview. It can be a bit difficult to determine where to look during a virtual interview. Do you look directly into the camera or do you look at the screen to see their face? The better thing is to actually look at their face.</p>

                <p>By watching their face on the screen, you’ll be able to mimic their facial expressions and you’ll appear more attentive since your eyes will naturally switch between their two eyes and mouth as they speak. This means your eyes will be moving naturally, showing your interest, rather than staring straight on into a black lens.</p>

                <strong>Have Things Ready</strong>

                <p>In a traditional interview, you would want to bring extra copies of your resume, a list of references, a pen and paper, and a portfolio when applicable. With a virtual interview, you should have a note open on your screen with links to your resume so that you can send it again if needed. Ask the interviewer when it starts if they’d like you to do so.</p>

                <p>You can take notes on your keyboard, but sound wise, it would be more polite and professional to actually scribble it down on a pad on your desk. Let the interview know that’s what you’re doing if the need arises for you to write something, this way they know you aren’t just distracted or scribbling away.</p>

                <p>At the end of the interview, let them know that you have prepared a list of references if they would like you to send it to them. Get their best email so that you can do so as soon as the interview is over. You might even luck out after such a fantastic interview and be told, “No, I think we’re ready to move forward right away!”</p>

              </div>
              <div className="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-ten" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-ten-tab">
                <p>If your interview has gone off without a hitch, you can expect to hear back within a few days. In some cases, the office will be especially swamped and they may say it will be a week or two before they’re able to get back to you.</p>

                <p>Once they give you that timeline of when you can expect a response, allow 1-2 extra days and, if you don’t hear from them, follow-up about the opportunity. This means calling or emailing the most direct (highest up) person you can get ahold to and asking to speak with your interviewer so that you can see if they were still interested in hiring you for the position.</p>

                <p>After you get a yes answer from someone, you’re ready to move on to the onboarding process.</p>

                <strong>What Is The Onboarding Process?</strong>

                <p>  Whether working on-site or off-site, every new employee can expect to go through an onboarding process of some sort. As a remote worker, it can be a bit different though. First, you’ll likely be virtually introduced to other people you’ll be collaborating with.</p>

                <p>Your manager may set up a conference call so that you can discuss with everyone who will be working with you directly. Or, depending on the company culture, they may just invite you right into your department’s Slack group and have you say your hello’s through there.</p>

                <p>Someone will then be responsible for walking you through the platform you’ll be using to log your time, which might even be handled by an automated setup wizard.</p>

                <p>As you are walked through the process, you’ll get the chance to ask questions along the way. Be sure to take notes too because asking the same questions over again will not look good. With that said, don’t be afraid to ask for clarification once or even twice when you need it.
  As a software developer, you are more than likely going to be given a few sample tasks and duties to help you adapt to the new systems and tools, and so they can judge your skills and strengths once again.</p>

                <p>Some companies will have a walkthrough that will take you through your “first assignment” and things like clocking in/out, reporting problems, and so on. They may use tools like Slack to keep you in touch with your team or tools like Trello so you can monitor your projects and workflows.</p>

                <p>  You should get some information about these tools during the interview process. If they do not openly tell you about the systems or platforms they are using, be sure to ask so that you can go ahead and familiarize yourself with these interfaces in advance. Then, on your first day “at work”, you’ll have an easier time getting yourself setup.</p>

                <p>During the onboarding period, this is when you’ll be assigned a company email account, given access to a company calendar/workflow/schedule of some kind, and being given information so you can communicate with people on the team.</p>

                <strong>The “Test” Period</strong>

                <p>Most companies hire new employees in a trial period, which means they have 30 to 60 days to fire you without having to deal with write-ups or warnings. If they fire you during this period, they’ll simply say: “It isn’t working out.”</p>

                <p>Obviously, you never want that to happen, which is why you should be fully engaged during your first few months on the job. Make an effort to learn the systems you have been given access to and virtually meet with those who you will be collaborating with in the long-term.</p>

                <p>The hope is that your company will be able to setup a meeting or phone call so that all of your closest team members can be officially introduced to you, which can make collaboration a lot simpler going forward. However, if it’s really busy, if they’re short-handed, or if the teams tend to work at different times, this can be really hard to setup. Don’t be pushy and ask for this, just be introduced as you go along.</p>

                <p>During the test period, you should be regularly conversing with your supervisor or whoever they say is the person to go to with your questions. In order to better understand what’s going to be expected of you, go to your supervisor to ask things like:</p>


                <ul>
                  <li>Do I need to send reports about my individual progress? If so, how often and who do I sent them to?</li>
                  <li>How will my first task be assigned? Who do I inform when I complete it?</li>
                  <li>Who should I go to with questions?</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Supervisors expect new employees to take a little while to adapt to their new job, what they are looking for are signs that you are trying to adapt to your new job. This means you using new systems, looking at your tools and practicing with them, and reaching out to your fellow team members to get a feel for who you’ll be working with.</p>

                <p> Being a successful worker doesn’t take much. As a remote software developer, you’ll just need to demonstrate commitment to your job and an understanding of what is expected of you. When you have questions, know who you should take them to and don’t be afraid to ask.</p>

                <p>When you run into issues, whatever they may be, just know to alert your supervisor as far in advance as possible and let them know if it will effect or delay your work in any way. Keeping them in the loop will greatly increase their trust and confidence in you as a remote worker.</p>

                <p>While some companies use screen capture tools and time tracking platforms to see when their remote workers are actually working on a project, you might luck out and be trusted enough to do things on your own schedule and at your own time. Regardless, you need to remember how important communication is.</p>

                <p>You should be sending progress reports as often as they are required and, even when not required, you should give a shout-out on Slack or your communication tool to let your team members know your progress on X, Y, or Z.</p>

                <p>Finally, just because you’re a remote worker, it doesn’t mean you can’t try to build valuable work relationships with those on your team. Slack and other communication tools allow employees to stay in touch with one another throughout the work day.</p>

                <p>And, of course, when you all complete a project together, be sure to give the hardest workers a big shout out. Likewise, when someone helps you with something, give them a public “thank you” as well to help show your team spirit. This is something your manager will really appreciate, and so will other members on your team. It shows that you are there to support your team towards the achievement of a common goal and not just out to hog all the credit or clock in/clock out.</p>

                <p>By striking up conversations, you can make the workday more fun and engage with your fellow team members. That's something that supervisors really want to see! In this way, you are extending the company culture far beyond its physical boundaries and cultivating a work community that is filled with fun, focus, and support for the company itself.</p>

                <p>With all of this advice in mind, you can go on to become a successful remote software developer. There are plenty of open positions out there, so get to networking and start applying for the ones that really fit your wants and needs.</p>


                <strong>Good luck!</strong>
